# Yet another FIRE blog?

I know what you are thinking - does the world need another Financial Independence Retire Early (FIRE) blog? Stay with me for a little bit.

I have been following FI community for a while now and largely I agree with principles and outcome. So, why am I writing this when I can just retire and enjoy life the way god intended? because, it's important to not lose sight of purpose when you become financially independent.
