# Yet another FIRE blog?

I know what you are thinking - does the world need another Financial Independence Retire Early (FIRE) blog? Stay with me for a little bit.

I have been following FI community for a while now and largely I agree with principles and outcome. So, why am I writing this when I can just retire and enjoy life the way god intended? because, it's important to not lose sight of purpose when you become financially independent.


Few years ago, when I had no kids, I would totally have retired, gone to an unknown island, and nobody would have ever heard from me again; end of my FIRE story!

Since you're hearing from me, I have (obviously) not vanished and I want to talk about something and people in FIRE community rarely talk about - making the world a better place for next generation!
